# Blender_StartUp_Template
Start Up Template for Blender with more refined UX

Features:

Removed:
A cube as a starting primitive.
Camera.
Light Source.

Changed:
Default snapping is set to Verices (Layot and UV Editor).
Face Orientation is on by default now.
Solid view in viewport is set to "textured".
Gizmos in upper right corner of a Viewport are hidden now.

Why?
If you have some experience with blender - you don't need most of the "entry level" features. 
The aim is to develop "all cases" template that will allow you to "launch and work" with Blender effectively.
